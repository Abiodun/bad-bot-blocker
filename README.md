Bad Bot Blocker
===============

231 htaccess rules to block bad bots.

Some of the stuff blocked:

- E-mail harvesters
- Content scrapers
- Spam bots
- Aggressive bots that provide little value
- Bots linked to viruses or malware
- Government surveillance bots
- Russian search engine Yandex
- Chinese search engine Baidu

You should disable the rules for Yandex or Baidu if you want
them to index your website. Unless your website is written
in Russian or Chinese, you probably won't get any traffic
from them. They mostly just waste bandwidth.
